## Components

- **Reverse proxy (optional)** — network-layer auth boundary in front of
  `ledger serve`; examples in `deploy/proxy/` (Caddy mTLS,
  nginx mTLS, Authelia OIDC); see Auth boundary section below
- CLI boundary (`typer` library) for operator workflows
- Config/secrets layer (`config.py`)
- SQLite bootstrap and persistence layer (`db.py` + `schema.sql`)
- Multi-item config loader (`items_config.py`) — parses `items.toml` into typed
  item definitions
- Production preflight checks (`preflight.py`) — pure, unit-testable checks
  for live-readiness validation
- Plaid client wrapper (`plaid_adapter.py`)
- Sync engine (`sync_engine.py`)
- HTTP server (`server.py`) — thin FastAPI app factory (~50 lines); assembles
  middleware and routers; no route handlers or business logic
- Middleware package (`middleware/`) — `auth.py` (bearer token),
  `correlation.py` (`CorrelationIdMiddleware`), `ip_allowlist.py`
  (`WebhookIPAllowlistMiddleware`)
- Router package (`routers/`) — domain-scoped `APIRouter` modules:
  `health.py` (`GET /health`, `GET /errors`), `transactions.py`
  (`GET /transactions`, `GET /transactions/{id}`, `PUT /annotations/{id}`),
  `spend.py` (`GET /spend`, `GET /spend/trends`), `accounts.py`
  (`GET /accounts`, `PUT /accounts/{id}`, `GET /categories`, `GET /tags`),
  `webhooks.py` (`POST /webhooks/plaid`, `_background_sync`, scheduled-sync
  helpers, `lifespan`); `utils.py` shared date-range helpers and
  `_strict_params` (BUG-014 unknown-query-parameter enforcement)
- Logging utilities (`logging_utils.py`) — `CorrelationIdFilter` injects
  correlation IDs into every log record; `LedgerDbHandler` persists WARNING+
  records to `ledger_errors` automatically during server operation
- OpenClaw notifier (`notifier.py`) — sends `POST /hooks/agent` to wake Hestia after a non-empty sync

## Auth boundary

`ledger serve` enforces a **two-layer auth model**:

### Layer 1 — Network layer: reverse proxy (optional, operator-configured)

A reverse proxy in front of `ledger serve` provides the first auth boundary.
Operators choose the pattern that matches their access model:

| Pattern | Mechanism | Best for |
|---|---|---|
| **Caddy mTLS** | Client certificate signed by a trusted CA | Automated agents, home-LAN access, no external IdP |
| **nginx mTLS** | Same as Caddy, nginx variant | Operators already running nginx |
| **Authelia OIDC** | OIDC/SSO front-proxy with optional MFA | Browser access, shared household, per-user audit logs |

Configuration examples live in `deploy/proxy/`:

```
deploy/proxy/
  Caddyfile.example         Caddy v2 mTLS — TLS termination + client cert enforcement
  nginx-mtls.conf.example   nginx equivalent using ssl_verify_client
  authelia-notes.md         Authelia OIDC/SSO integration guide
```

When a reverse proxy is present it sets `X-Forwarded-For` to the real client
IP. `CLAW_TRUSTED_PROXIES` must list the proxy host IP so the application
resolves the original source correctly (used by the webhook IP allowlist).

**Routes that bypass client-cert enforcement** (open to monitoring tools):
- `GET /health`
- `GET /docs`
- `GET /openapi.json`

All other routes (`/transactions`, `/annotations`, `/spend`,
`/webhooks/plaid`) require a valid client certificate when mTLS is active.

### Layer 2 — Application layer: CLAW_API_SECRET bearer token (always required)

Every protected HTTP endpoint verifies `Authorization: Bearer <CLAW_API_SECRET>`
regardless of which network-layer pattern is in use.  This ensures that a
misconfigured proxy or network rule cannot expose financial data.

```
Internet / LAN
      │
      ▼
[Reverse proxy — mTLS or OIDC]   ← Layer 1 (optional, operator-configured)
      │
      ▼
[ledger serve — FastAPI/uvicorn] ← Layer 2: CLAW_API_SECRET bearer token
      │
      ▼
[SQLite — financial data]
```

See RUNBOOK.md Section 14 for the full auth-hardening walkthrough including
certificate generation, Caddy/nginx configuration, and cert rotation.

## Data flow

### Two-agent routing sequence

1. **Plaid sync event**: `SYNC_UPDATES_AVAILABLE` arrives and starts a
   background sync for the mapped item.
2. **Hestia annotation pass**: when the sync has non-zero changes, notifier
   wakes Hestia via `/hooks/agent` for ingestion-time annotation updates.
3. **Athena analysis**: Athena runs on its own cadence or when anomalies are
   flagged; it is not woken for every sync event.

```
Plaid API -> sync engine -> SQLite raw records -> canonical view layer -> Agent API -> OpenClaw agent
                  |                                        |
                  +--[non-empty sync]--> OpenClaw /hooks/agent (Hestia wake)
items.toml -------------------------------> source precedence mappings (suppressed_accounts)

items.toml ─┐
            ├─ ledger sync --all ─> [bank-alice] run_sync -> SQLite
            │                    -> [bank-bob]   run_sync -> SQLite
            │                    -> [card-alice] run_sync -> SQLite
PLAID_ENV  ─┘

Webhook-first ingestion:

       ├─ item_id not in items.toml ────> WARNING + _background_sync() [legacy]
       └─ no item_id / no items.toml ──> _background_sync() [legacy]

Scheduled sync fallback (opt-in):

_scheduled_sync_loop (every 60 min)
  └─ _check_and_sync_overdue_items


       ├─ items.toml present ──> per-item last_synced_at check
       │                             overdue → _background_sync(token, item_id, owner)
       │                             recent  → skip (DEBUG log)
       └─ no items.toml ──────> single-item PLAID_ACCESS_TOKEN fallback
```

### Operator handoff

- **Skill install source**: `skills/hestia-ledger/` and `skills/athena-ledger/`
  are copy-ready bundles for downstream agent runtimes.
- **Default wake target**: non-empty sync notifications wake Hestia only.
- **Analysis cadence**: Athena is intentionally decoupled and should run on a
  periodic schedule, optionally prioritizing `needs-athena-review` tags.

The sync engine writes to `transactions`, `accounts`, and `sync_state`. It
never touches `annotations`. Source precedence is applied after sync writes via
`ledger apply-precedence`; canonical filtering happens in query/view logic,
never by deleting raw rows. Agents read transactions and write annotations
exclusively through the HTTP API.

After a webhook-triggered sync where `added + modified + removed > 0`, the
notifier sends a `POST` to the configured OpenClaw `/hooks/agent` endpoint.
Zero-change syncs skip the notification entirely.

## Boundaries

- Secrets stay outside the workspace and are loaded via environment variables.
- SQLite is the source of truth for local financial state.
- Database writes should be deterministic and idempotent across reruns.
- CLI commands orchestrate workflows but should not contain raw Plaid API setup.
- The `annotations` table is entirely agent-owned; the sync engine must never
  read from or write to it.
- Plaid-sourced tables (`transactions`, `accounts`, `sync_state`) are immutable
  from the agent's perspective.

> We are separating imported financial events from budgeting semantics. Plaid
> transactions remain immutable settlement records, while allocations represent
> how spending is categorized for budgeting and analysis.

## Key entities

- `account`
- `account_label` (agent/operator-owned; sync engine never touches this)
- `transaction`
- `annotation` (agent-owned; sync engine never touches this)
- `sync_state`
- `ledger_errors` (server-owned; written by `LedgerDbHandler`; read via `GET /errors`)

Deferred entities (`review_item`, rules) land in later phases.

## Schema

### `transactions`

Core Plaid transaction data. Written by the sync engine; read by the API.
Keyed by `plaid_transaction_id` (Plaid-issued stable string, safe for agents
to cache across sessions).

**Effective date:** `COALESCE(posted_date, authorized_date)` — for posted
transactions `posted_date` is set; for pending ones only `authorized_date` is
set.

**Amount sign convention:** positive = money leaving the account
(debit/expense), negative = money entering (credit/income). Amounts are
exposed exactly as stored — not inverted.

### `accounts`

Plaid account metadata. Written by the sync engine on each sync run.
`canonical_account_id` is nullable: `NULL` means the account is canonical;
non-null means the account is suppressed in canonical views and points to the
winning canonical Plaid account.

```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS accounts (
    id                   INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    plaid_account_id     TEXT NOT NULL UNIQUE,
    name                 TEXT NOT NULL,
    mask                 TEXT,
    type                 TEXT NOT NULL,
    subtype              TEXT,
    owner                TEXT,
    item_id              TEXT,
    canonical_account_id TEXT,
    institution_name     TEXT
);
```

### `account_labels`

Operator- and agent-authored human-readable labels for Plaid accounts.
Keyed on `plaid_account_id`. Written via `PUT /accounts/{account_id}`;
read by `GET /accounts` via a LEFT JOIN on `accounts`. The sync engine
never reads from or writes to this table.

```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS account_labels (
    id               INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    plaid_account_id TEXT NOT NULL UNIQUE,
    label            TEXT,
    description      TEXT,
    created_at       TEXT NOT NULL,
    updated_at       TEXT NOT NULL
);
```

| Column | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `plaid_account_id` | TEXT | FK to `accounts.plaid_account_id`; unique per label row |
| `label` | TEXT \| NULL | Short human-readable name (e.g. "Alice Joint Checking") |
| `description` | TEXT \| NULL | Longer free-text description |
| `created_at` | TEXT | ISO 8601 UTC; set on first insert; never changed on update |
| `updated_at` | TEXT | ISO 8601 UTC; updated on every upsert |

### `sync_state`

One row per Plaid item (institution). Stores the Plaid sync cursor and the
timestamp of the last successful sync.

### `ledger_errors`

Server-written error log. Populated automatically by `LedgerDbHandler` during
server operation; never written by CLI sync commands or the sync engine. Rows
older than 30 days are pruned on each insert (same transaction). Read via
`GET /errors`.

```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS ledger_errors (
    id             INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    severity       TEXT NOT NULL,    -- Python level name: 'WARNING', 'ERROR', 'CRITICAL'
    logger_name    TEXT NOT NULL,    -- e.g. 'claw_plaid_ledger.server'
    message        TEXT NOT NULL,
    correlation_id TEXT,             -- request_id or sync_run_id; NULL outside any context
    created_at     TEXT NOT NULL     -- ISO 8601 UTC
);
```

### `annotations`

Agent-owned annotation data. **The sync engine never reads from or writes to
this table.** Created by `init-db`; managed entirely via
`PUT /annotations/{transaction_id}`.

```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS annotations (
    id                   INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    plaid_transaction_id TEXT NOT NULL UNIQUE
                         REFERENCES transactions(plaid_transaction_id),
    category             TEXT,
    note                 TEXT,
    tags                 TEXT,          -- JSON array stored as text, e.g. '["food","recurring"]'
    created_at           TEXT NOT NULL,
    updated_at           TEXT NOT NULL
);
```

Column notes:

| Column | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `id` | INTEGER | Auto-incrementing primary key |
| `plaid_transaction_id` | TEXT | FK to `transactions.plaid_transaction_id`; unique per annotation |
| `category` | TEXT \| NULL | Agent-assigned category label |
| `note` | TEXT \| NULL | Free-text agent note |
| `tags` | TEXT \| NULL | JSON array stored as text (e.g. `'["food","recurring"]'`); `null` when no tags |
| `created_at` | TEXT | ISO 8601 UTC timestamp; set on first insert; never changed on update |
| `updated_at` | TEXT | ISO 8601 UTC timestamp; updated on every upsert |

## Interfaces

Current operator-facing CLI commands:

- `doctor` — validates config, DB connectivity, schema, and reports row counts;
  with `--verbose` shows redacted config values
- `apply-precedence` — reads `suppressed_accounts` from `items.toml` and
  writes source-precedence mappings to `accounts.canonical_account_id`;
  clears stale mappings no longer present in config
- `doctor --production-preflight` — validates live-readiness configuration
  without contacting external services; exits non-zero if any required check
  fails; see `RUNBOOK.md` for usage in the production onboarding checklist
- `init-db` — creates the SQLite database and initializes the schema (safe to
  run against an existing database; uses `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS`)
- `items` — shows per-item health (token presence, account count, last sync
  timestamp) for all entries in `items.toml`; exits 0 always; the standard
  daily health-check command before running `sync --all`
- `link` — guides the operator through the Plaid Link browser flow and prints
  the resulting `access_token` and `items.toml` snippet
- `overlaps` — displays configured suppression rules, DB status
  (`IN DB`/`MISMATCH`/`NOT YET SYNCED`), and potential unconfirmed overlaps
- `sync` — fetches transactions from Plaid and persists them to SQLite;
  `sync --all` is the standard household ingestion path; `sync --item <id>`
  syncs a single item from `items.toml`
- `serve` — starts the FastAPI/uvicorn HTTP server; binds to
  `CLAW_SERVER_HOST:CLAW_SERVER_PORT` (default `127.0.0.1:8000`)

## HTTP endpoints

All endpoints are served by `ledger serve`.

### `GET /health`

Returns `{"status": "ok"}`. No authentication required.

### `POST /webhooks/plaid`

Receives Plaid webhook events. Requires bearer token auth and Plaid
HMAC-SHA256 signature verification (`Plaid-Verification` header). Returns 400
on invalid signature.

#### Webhook ingress IP allowlisting

When `CLAW_WEBHOOK_ALLOWED_IPS` is configured, a middleware layer enforces
source IP filtering before any route handler runs.  IP resolution order:

1. If the direct connection IP is in `CLAW_TRUSTED_PROXIES` (default:
   `127.0.0.1`), take the **leftmost** `X-Forwarded-For` address as the real
   client IP.
2. Otherwise, use the direct connection IP.

If the resolved IP does not fall within any configured CIDR, the middleware
returns HTTP 403 `{"detail": "forbidden"}` and logs a WARNING with the
resolved IP and `request_id`.  The route handler and all other middleware
downstream are bypassed.

When `CLAW_WEBHOOK_ALLOWED_IPS` is unset or empty, the middleware is
transparent and all other routes are unaffected in all configurations.

On `SYNC_UPDATES_AVAILABLE`:

1. Extracts `item_id` from the payload.
2. If `item_id` is present and matches a configured `ItemConfig` in
   `items.toml`, enqueues `_background_sync()` with that item's access token,
   item ID, and owner.
3. If `item_id` is present but not found in `items.toml`, logs a WARNING and
   falls back to the `PLAID_ACCESS_TOKEN` single-item sync.
4. If `item_id` is absent or `items.toml` is not loadable, falls back to the
   single-item sync silently.

Returns 200 immediately; the sync runs in the background.
Unrecognized webhook types are acknowledged with 200 and logged at warning
level.

### `GET /transactions`

Returns a paginated, filtered list of transactions.

**Query parameters** (all optional):

| Parameter | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `start_date` | `YYYY-MM-DD` | — | Filter: effective date ≥ start_date (inclusive). Effective date = `COALESCE(posted_date, authorized_date)` |
| `end_date` | `YYYY-MM-DD` | — | Filter: effective date ≤ end_date (inclusive) |
| `range` | string | — | Shorthand date window: `last_month`, `this_month`, `last_30_days`, `last_7_days`. Resolved server-side; explicit `start_date`/`end_date` take precedence when both are provided |
| `account_id` | string | — | Filter: exact match on `plaid_account_id` |
| `pending` | bool | — | Filter: `true` returns only pending; `false` returns only posted |
| `min_amount` | float | — | Filter: amount ≥ min_amount (inclusive). Plaid sign: positive = debit |
| `max_amount` | float | — | Filter: amount ≤ max_amount (inclusive) |
| `keyword` | string | — | Filter: case-insensitive substring match on `name` and `merchant_name`; also matches `annotations.note` when `search_notes=true` |
| `tags` | list[string] | `[]` | Filter: transaction annotation must include **all** listed tags (AND semantics); pass `?tags=a&tags=b` |
| `search_notes` | bool | `false` | If true and `keyword` is set, include annotation `note` in keyword search |
| `limit` | int | `100` | Maximum rows to return; max `500`; `limit > 500` returns HTTP 422 |
| `offset` | int | `0` | Number of matching rows to skip (for pagination) |
| `view` | `canonical` \\| `raw` | `canonical` | `canonical` excludes suppressed-account rows via source precedence; `raw` returns all rows |

**Response** (HTTP 200):

```json
{
  "transactions": [
    {
      "id": "<plaid_transaction_id>",
      "account_id": "<plaid_account_id>",
      "amount": 12.34,
      "iso_currency_code": "USD",
      "name": "Starbucks",
      "merchant_name": "Starbucks",
      "pending": false,
      "date": "2024-01-15",
      "annotation": {
        "category": "coffee",
        "note": "morning latte",
        "tags": ["coffee", "recurring"],
        "updated_at": "2024-06-01T10:00:00+00:00"
      }
    }
  ],
  "total": 150,
  "limit": 100,
  "offset": 0
}
```

- `total` is the full matching count before `limit`/`offset` are applied.
- Empty result set returns HTTP 200 with `"transactions": []` and `"total": 0`.
- `date` is `COALESCE(posted_date, authorized_date)`.
- `annotation` is `null` for transactions with no annotation row; otherwise the
  object is field-for-field identical to the `annotation` block in
  `GET /transactions/{id}`.

### `GET /categories`

Returns the distinct set of non-null `category` values present across all
annotation rows, sorted alphabetically (case-insensitive).

**Response** (HTTP 200):

```json
{"categories": ["food", "software", "transport", "utilities"]}
```

- Empty array when no annotations have a category set.
- Requires bearer token auth.

### `GET /tags`

Returns the distinct set of tag values unnested from all annotation rows,
sorted alphabetically (case-insensitive).

**Response** (HTTP 200):

```json
{"tags": ["discretionary", "needs-athena-review", "recurring", "subscription"]}
```

- Empty array when no annotations have tags set.
- Requires bearer token auth.

### `GET /accounts`

Returns all synced accounts joined with any available label data from
`account_labels`. A household will have ≤ ~20 accounts; no pagination
is needed.

**Response** (HTTP 200):

```json
{
  "accounts": [
    {
      "account_id": "acc_abc123",
      "plaid_name": "Plaid Checking",
      "mask": "1234",
      "type": "depository",
      "subtype": "checking",
      "institution_name": "bank-alice",
      "owner": "alice",
      "item_id": "item-alice-001",
      "canonical_account_id": null,
      "label": "Alice Joint Checking",
      "description": "Primary joint household account"
    }
  ]
}
```

- `label` and `description` are `null` for accounts without a label row.
- `canonical_account_id` is non-null only for suppressed accounts (source
  precedence feature).
- Empty array if no accounts have been synced yet.
- Requires bearer token auth.

### `PUT /accounts/{account_id}`

Upserts label data for a given Plaid account ID.

**Request body** (both fields optional):

```json
{
  "label": "Alice Joint Checking",
  "description": "Primary joint household account"
}
```

Sending `null` for a field clears its value in the store.

**Response** — HTTP 200 with the full account record (same shape as one
entry from `GET /accounts`).  HTTP 404 if `account_id` does not exist in
the `accounts` table (pre-labelling an unseen account is not supported).

Requires bearer token auth.

### `GET /spend`

Returns aggregate spend totals for a date window.  The window can be
supplied either as explicit ISO dates or as a named range shorthand.

**Query parameters:**

| Parameter | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `range` | `last_month` \| `this_month` \| `last_30_days` \| `last_7_days` | — | Named range shorthand; derives `start_date`/`end_date` from server local time. |
| `start_date` | `YYYY-MM-DD` | required if `range` absent | Window start (inclusive); overrides range-derived start when both supplied. |
| `end_date` | `YYYY-MM-DD` | required if `range` absent | Window end (inclusive); overrides range-derived end when both supplied. |
| `owner` | string | — | Restrict to accounts tagged with this owner (`accounts.owner`). |
| `tags` | list[string] | `[]` | Annotation tags filter with AND semantics (`?tags=a&tags=b`). |
| `account_id` | string | — | Restrict to a single Plaid account (use `GET /accounts` to discover IDs). |
| `category` | string | — | Restrict to one annotation category (case-insensitive; use `GET /categories` for vocabulary). |
| `tag` | string | — | Restrict to one annotation tag (case-insensitive, singular; use `GET /tags` for vocabulary). |
| `include_pending` | bool | `false` | Include pending transactions when true; otherwise only posted rows are summed. |
| `view` | `canonical` \| `raw` | `canonical` | Canonical excludes suppressed-account rows; raw includes all rows. |

**Range shorthand date resolution (server local time):**

| `range` value | `start_date` | `end_date` |
|---|---|---|
| `this_month` | First day of current month | Today |
| `last_month` | First day of previous calendar month | Last day of previous calendar month |
| `last_30_days` | Today − 30 days (inclusive) | Today |
| `last_7_days` | Today − 7 days (inclusive) | Today |

**Response** (HTTP 200):

```json
{
  "start_date": "2025-01-01",
  "end_date": "2025-01-31",
  "total_spend": 1234.56,
  "transaction_count": 42,
  "includes_pending": false,
  "filters": {
    "owner": "alice",
    "tags": ["groceries"],
    "account_id": null,
    "category": null,
    "tag": null
  }
}
```

- `total_spend` is the arithmetic sum of `amount` (Plaid sign convention is preserved).
- `transaction_count` is the number of matching rows before aggregation.
- Empty windows return zeros (`total_spend=0`, `transaction_count=0`) not `null`.

### `GET /spend/trends`

Returns spend aggregated by calendar month for a lookback window.  Always
returns exactly `months` buckets ordered oldest → newest, zero-filling any
month with no qualifying transactions.

**Query parameters:**

| Parameter | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `months` | integer ≥ 1 | `6` | Number of calendar months to return, ending with the current month. |
| `owner` | string | — | Restrict to accounts tagged with this owner. |
| `tags` | list[string] | `[]` | Annotation tags filter with AND semantics. |
| `account_id` | string | — | Restrict to a single Plaid account. |
| `category` | string | — | Restrict to one annotation category (case-insensitive). |
| `tag` | string | — | Restrict to one annotation tag (case-insensitive, singular). |
| `include_pending` | bool | `false` | Include pending transactions when true. |
| `view` | `canonical` \| `raw` | `canonical` | Canonical excludes suppressed-account rows; raw includes all rows. |

**Response** (HTTP 200) — a plain JSON array, oldest bucket first:

```json

  {"month": "2025-10", "total_spend": 3241.50, "transaction_count": 47, "partial": false},
  {"month": "2026-03", "total_spend": 850.00,  "transaction_count": 12, "partial": true}
]
```

- `month` — `YYYY-MM` label for the calendar month.
- `total_spend` — arithmetic sum of `amount` for matching transactions (Plaid sign convention preserved).
- `transaction_count` — number of matching rows.
- `partial` — `true` only on the current in-progress month; `false` on all complete prior months.
- Months with no qualifying transactions appear as `{"total_spend": 0.0, "transaction_count": 0}` — they are never omitted.
- `?months=0` or `?months=-1` returns HTTP 422.

All seven filter parameters produce results directly comparable to a matching
point-in-time `GET /spend` call over the same window and filters.

### `GET /transactions/{transaction_id}`

Returns full detail for one transaction, including a merged annotation block.
`transaction_id` in the path is the `plaid_transaction_id` string.

Returns HTTP 404 if not found.

**Response** (HTTP 200):

```json
{
  "id": "<plaid_transaction_id>",
  "account_id": "<plaid_account_id>",
  "amount": 12.34,
  "iso_currency_code": "USD",
  "name": "Starbucks",
  "merchant_name": "Starbucks",
  "pending": false,
  "date": "2024-01-15",
  "raw_json": "{...}",
  "annotation": {
    "category": "food",
    "note": "Morning coffee",
    "tags": ["discretionary", "recurring"],
    "updated_at": "2024-01-16T10:30:00Z"
  }
}
```

- `annotation` is `null` if no annotation exists for this transaction.
- `tags` in the response is a parsed JSON list (not the raw text stored in
  SQLite); if stored value is `null`, returns `null` for tags.
- `raw_json` is the raw Plaid API payload stored at sync time; may be `null`
  for transactions synced before this field was populated.

### `PUT /annotations/{transaction_id}`

Creates or fully replaces an annotation for a transaction.
`transaction_id` in the path is the `plaid_transaction_id` string.

This is a **full replace**, not a partial PATCH: every PUT completely overwrites
the annotation row. Omitted fields are stored as `null`.

**Request body** (all fields optional):

```json
{
  "category": "food",
  "note": "Morning coffee",
  "tags": ["discretionary", "recurring"]
}
```

- `tags` must be a JSON array of strings or `null`.
- Returns HTTP 404 if `transaction_id` does not exist in `transactions`.
  Agents cannot annotate phantom transactions.
- Returns HTTP 200 with the full transaction record (same shape as
  `GET /transactions/{transaction_id}`) on successful create or update.
  The `annotation` block in the response always reflects the values just
  written — it is never `null` in a successful PUT response.
- `created_at` is preserved on updates; `updated_at` is refreshed.
- No follow-up GET is needed to confirm the write.

### `GET /errors`

Returns recent ledger warnings and errors from `ledger_errors`, ordered newest
first. Requires bearer token auth.

**Query parameters:**

| Parameter | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `hours` | int ≥ 1 | `24` | Lookback window in hours. `?hours=0` returns HTTP 422. |
| `min_severity` | `WARNING` \| `ERROR` \| `null` | `null` | `null`/`WARNING` = all WARNING+ rows; `ERROR` = ERROR and CRITICAL only. |
| `limit` | int | `100` | Maximum rows to return; max `500`. |
| `offset` | int | `0` | Rows to skip (pagination). |

**Response** (HTTP 200):

```json
{
  "errors": [
    {
      "id": 1,
      "severity": "ERROR",
      "logger_name": "claw_plaid_ledger.server",
      "message": "background sync failed: connection refused",
      "correlation_id": "req-a1b2c3d4",
      "created_at": "2026-03-22T10:05:00.000000+00:00"
    }
  ],
  "total": 1,
  "limit": 100,
  "offset": 0,
  "since": "2026-03-21T10:05:00.000000+00:00"
}
```

- `total` is the full matching count before `limit`/`offset` are applied.
- `since` is the UTC datetime marking the start of the `hours` window.
- `correlation_id` is `null` for records emitted outside any request or sync context.
- Use `?min_severity=ERROR` to narrow to actionable failures only (exclude WARNING-level noise).

## OpenAPI / SKILL definition

FastAPI auto-generates a machine-readable OpenAPI spec at `GET /openapi.json`
and a Swagger UI at `GET /docs`. Both are served without authentication
(consistent with the local-only security posture).

`GET /openapi.json` is the **canonical machine-readable spec** intended
to seed the OpenClaw SKILL definition. Any agent that needs to
introspect the available API surface should fetch this endpoint rather than
reading the source code.

## OpenClaw notification

After a webhook-triggered sync, `_background_sync` in `routers/webhooks.py`
calls `notify_openclaw` from `notifier.py` when
`summary.added + summary.modified + summary.removed > 0`.

### When notification fires

- A Plaid `SYNC_UPDATES_AVAILABLE` webhook triggers a background sync.
- The sync returns a non-zero change count (at least one added, modified, or
  removed transaction).
- `OPENCLAW_HOOKS_TOKEN` is set to a non-empty value.

### When notification is skipped

- **Zero-change syncs:** if `added + modified + removed == 0`, the notifier is
  not called. The existing `logger.warning("sync returned no changes")` line
  fires instead.
- **Token not set:** if `OPENCLAW_HOOKS_TOKEN` is absent or set to an empty
  string, `notify_openclaw` logs a `WARNING` (`"OPENCLAW_HOOKS_TOKEN not set —
  skipping notification"`) and returns immediately. This is not an error; it is
  a valid operator choice.

### Failure behavior

Network errors (`urllib.error.URLError`) and non-2xx HTTP responses
(`urllib.error.HTTPError`) are caught inside `notify_openclaw`, logged at
`WARNING`, and never re-raised. The background sync task always completes
normally regardless of notification outcome.

### Payload shape

```json
{
  "message": "Plaid sync complete: 3 added, 1 modified. Hestia should run ingestion annotations; Athena reviews later on schedule or anomaly flags.",
  "name": "Hestia",
  "wakeMode": "now"
}
```

| Field | Description |
|---|---|
| `message` | Human-readable summary of non-zero change counts plus explicit Hestia-first / Athena-later routing guidance |
| `name` | Name of the OpenClaw agent to wake; controlled by `OPENCLAW_HOOKS_AGENT` |
| `wakeMode` | Wake mode for OpenClaw; controlled by `OPENCLAW_HOOKS_WAKE_MODE` (`now` is the only supported value) |

The message is built by joining the non-zero count fragments
(`"N added"`, `"N modified"`, `"N removed"`) with `", "` and appending
`". Hestia should run ingestion annotations; Athena reviews later on
schedule or anomaly flags."`.

### HTTP request

The notifier uses `urllib.request` (Python standard library) — no new runtime
dependency is added. `httpx` remains a dev/test-only dependency.

```
POST <OPENCLAW_HOOKS_URL>
Content-Type: application/json
Authorization: Bearer <OPENCLAW_HOOKS_TOKEN>
```


## Multi-institution management

### Purpose

Multi-item sync allows one command to process every Plaid item in a
household (for example personal bank, shared credit card, partner accounts)
without manually editing environment variables between runs.

### `items.toml` location and format

Default path:

`~/.config/claw-plaid-ledger/items.toml`

Example (see also `items.toml.example` at the repo root):

```toml
[[items]]
id                = "bank-alice"
access_token_env  = "PLAID_ACCESS_TOKEN_BANK_ALICE"
owner             = "alice"

[[items]]
id                = "card-alice"
access_token_env  = "PLAID_ACCESS_TOKEN_CARD_ALICE"
owner             = "alice"

[[items]]
id                = "card-bob"
access_token_env  = "PLAID_ACCESS_TOKEN_CARD_BOB"
owner             = "bob"
```

Fields:

| Field | Required | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `id` | yes | string | Operator-assigned item identifier used as `sync_state.item_id` |
| `access_token_env` | yes | string | Name of the environment variable that stores this item's Plaid access token |
| `owner` | no | string \| null | Free-form ownership tag; omitted/null is treated as `None` |

### `sync --all` behavior

- The CLI loads all `ItemConfig` entries from `items.toml`.
- It constructs one shared Plaid adapter from shared client credentials
  (`PLAID_CLIENT_ID`, `PLAID_SECRET`, `PLAID_ENV`).
- It iterates items sequentially and resolves each access token from the
  configured `access_token_env` name at runtime.
- Each item is synced independently via `run_sync` with its own `item_id`,
  cursor, and `owner`.

Per-item failures are isolated: if one item fails (missing env var, invalid
token, network issue), the run logs an error for that item and continues with
the remaining items. The command exits with status code 1 if any item failed,
or 0 if all items succeeded.

### Owner semantics and design decision

The `owner` tag is stored on:

- `sync_state.owner`
- `accounts.owner`

Hestia uses this metadata by first determining which accounts belong to which
item, then filtering transaction queries by `account_id`. No `owner` column was
added to `transactions`, and no Agent API contract changes were required.

Design decision: ownership scoping is a naming convention anchored at the
item/account level, not a transaction-level schema dimension. This keeps
transaction storage unchanged and avoids duplicating owner metadata across every
transaction row.

### Legacy single-item mode remains valid

The legacy path (`ledger sync` with no item flags) still reads:

- `PLAID_ACCESS_TOKEN`
- `CLAW_PLAID_LEDGER_ITEM_ID` (default `default-item`)

This mode behaves as before and writes `owner=None`.

## Configuration

All configuration is loaded from environment variables (or a user `.env` file
at `~/.config/claw-plaid-ledger/.env`). See `.env.example` for all supported
keys.

Key variables:

| Variable | Required | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `CLAW_PLAID_LEDGER_DB_PATH` | yes | — | Path to the SQLite database file |
| `PLAID_CLIENT_ID` | for sync | — | Plaid API client ID |
| `PLAID_SECRET` | for sync | — | Plaid API secret |
| `PLAID_ENV` | for sync | — | Plaid environment (`sandbox`, `production`) |
| `PLAID_ACCESS_TOKEN` | for sync (single-item mode) | — | Plaid access token for the linked item |
| `CLAW_PLAID_LEDGER_ITEM_ID` | no | `default-item` | Item ID for single-item mode (legacy path) |
| `CLAW_PLAID_LEDGER_WORKSPACE_PATH` | no | — | Path to OpenClaw workspace for exports |
| `CLAW_SERVER_HOST` | no | `127.0.0.1` | Host for `ledger serve` to bind to (local-only by default) |
| `CLAW_SERVER_PORT` | no | `8000` | TCP port for `ledger serve` to listen on |
| `CLAW_API_SECRET` | for serve | — | Bearer token required on all non-health HTTP endpoints; server refuses to start if unset |
| `PLAID_WEBHOOK_SECRET` | for webhooks | — | Shared secret used to verify Plaid webhook HMAC-SHA256 signatures; if unset all webhook signature checks fail closed |
| `CLAW_LOG_LEVEL` | no | `INFO` | Log level for the HTTP server; must be one of `DEBUG`, `INFO`, `WARNING`, `ERROR`, `CRITICAL`; invalid value raises `ConfigError` at startup |
| `OPENCLAW_HOOKS_URL` | no | `http://127.0.0.1:18789/hooks/agent` | OpenClaw `/hooks/agent` endpoint URL |
| `OPENCLAW_HOOKS_TOKEN` | no | — | Bearer token for OpenClaw; if unset, notification is skipped with a warning |
| `OPENCLAW_HOOKS_AGENT` | no | `Hestia` | Name of the OpenClaw ingestion agent to wake (Hestia in the two-agent flow) |
| `OPENCLAW_HOOKS_WAKE_MODE` | no | `now` | Wake mode passed to OpenClaw (`now` is the only supported value) |
| `CLAW_SCHEDULED_SYNC_ENABLED` | no | `false` | Enable the scheduled sync fallback loop; set to `true` to activate |
| `CLAW_SCHEDULED_SYNC_FALLBACK_HOURS` | no | `24` | Hours of sync silence before an item is treated as overdue; minimum 1; values ≤ 0 cause a startup error |
| `CLAW_WEBHOOK_ALLOWED_IPS` | no | — | Comma-separated IPv4/IPv6 CIDRs allowed to POST to `/webhooks/plaid`; unset = no IP filtering |
| `CLAW_TRUSTED_PROXIES` | no | `127.0.0.1` | Comma-separated IPs of trusted reverse proxies for `X-Forwarded-For` resolution; used only when `CLAW_WEBHOOK_ALLOWED_IPS` is set |

`items.toml` is a separate configuration file (not an environment variable)
used by `sync --all` and `sync --item`. Default path:
`~/.config/claw-plaid-ledger/items.toml`.

## Quality gate

A change is ready to merge only when all required checks pass:

1. `uv run --locked ruff format . --check`
2. `uv run --locked ruff check .`
3. `uv run --locked mypy .`
4. `uv run --locked pytest`

## Logging conventions

The runtime uses a correlation-aware log format:

```
%(asctime)s %(levelname)s %(name)s [%(correlation_id)s]: %(message)s
```

Correlation behavior:

- Request scope: middleware generates `request_id` (`req-xxxxxxxx`), stores it
  in request context, logs request start/end, and returns `X-Request-Id` on
  every response.
- Sync scope: each sync run emits a `sync_run_id` (`sync-xxxxxxxx`) propagated
  through sync-layer log lines (CLI, scheduled loop, webhook-triggered sync).
- Outside request/sync scope, `correlation_id` renders as `-`.

### Error persistence

`LedgerDbHandler` (in `logging_utils.py`) is installed on the root logger
during server `lifespan()`. It captures every WARNING, ERROR, and CRITICAL
record emitted by any logger during server operation and writes it to the
`ledger_errors` table. A `threading.local()` re-entrancy guard prevents
infinite recursion if the DB layer itself logs at WARNING+.

The handler is not installed for CLI commands (`ledger sync`, `ledger sync
--all`). CLI sync runs are interactive and have terminal output; extending
error persistence to the CLI is deferred.

Secret-redaction policy:

- Never log bearer tokens, Plaid secrets, or Plaid access tokens at any level.
- DEBUG webhook payload logs must be redacted first (remove token/secret/password
  fields and sensitive headers) before emission.
- Transaction/account data and sync cursors may be logged at DEBUG/INFO as needed
  for operations.
